# Placeholder for alarm sound file

# The system expects an alarm.wav file here for audio alerts.
# You can use any .wav file, or the system will fall back to system beeps.

# To create an alarm:
# 1. Use any free alarm sound (ensure proper licensing)
# 2. Convert to WAV: ffmpeg -i alarm.mp3 alarm.wav
# 3. Place the file in this folder as alarm.wav
